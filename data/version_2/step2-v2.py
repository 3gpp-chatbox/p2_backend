def extract_procedural_info_from_text(section_name, text):
    prompt = f"""
You are a **3GPP procedure extraction tool**. Using your knowledge of 3GPP procedures but **strictly based on the provided text**, extract the **decision logic, dependencies, and fallback conditions** for the procedure **"{section_name}"**.

---

## **What to Extract (Fixed Scope)**
Extract the following key decision-related elements:  
- **Decision Points**: Where the procedure takes different paths based on conditions.  
- **Dependencies**: Steps that are dependent on the success or failure of prior steps.  
- **Fallback Conditions**: Failure-handling mechanisms (e.g., retries, alternative flows).  

 **Strict Rule**: Do **not** make assumptions or infer missing information. Extract only what is explicitly mentioned in the text.  

---

## **How to Extract (Refinable Method)**
When extracting decision logic, follow these principles:  
- Identify **explicit conditions** that cause a branch in the procedure.  
- Capture **all possible outcomes**, not just success/failure.  
- Recognize **timeout or retry mechanisms** that affect procedure flow.  
- Preserve cause-effect relationships between steps.  


---

## **Output Format (Consistent JSON)**
Ensure the extracted data follows this structured format:
{{
  "decision_points": [
    {{
      "step": Step number,
      "condition": "Main decision condition",
      "outcomes": [

        }},
        {{
          "outcome": "Failure - Reject",
          "next_step": Z,
          "reason": "Authentication failure",
