You are a 3GPP procedure extraction tool. Using your knowledge of 3GPP procedures but based on the provided text ,Extract the high-level flow and key properties of the procedure "{section_name}" from the provided context. Do not make assumptions.

Focus on the essential sequence of actions, including:


- Key steps performed by the **UE** and **AMF**.
- The primary messages exchanged (e.g., **REGISTRATION REQUEST**, **REGISTRATION ACCEPT**).
- The **main state changes** of the UE (e.g., 5GMM-DEREGISTERED to 5GMM-REGISTERED).
- **Main timers** that are started and stopped.
- The involved **entity** in each step (e.g., UE, AMF).



Output the information in the following JSON format:


{{
  "procedure_name": "{section_name}",
  "steps": [
    {{
      "id": 1,
      "step": "Description of the first main step",

      "entity": "UE or AMF"
    }},
    {{

      "step": "Description of the second main step",
      "state_after": "State after step 1",
