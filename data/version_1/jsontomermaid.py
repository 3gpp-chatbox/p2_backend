convert the provided JSON code to Mermaid syntax for a flow property graph.

I need the flow property graph to include detailed relationships between nodes. A flow property graph should highlight state transitions, events, and properties involved in the procedure. This includes metadata like conditions, actions, timers, etc.

### Hereâ€™s what I need:

**Nodes:**
- Represent entities (e.g., states, processes, timers, or decisions).
- For example: UE, AMF, T3510 timers, etc.

**Edges:**
- Represent transitions between nodes.
- Each edge should include properties such as:
  - Event triggers
  - Conditions
  - Actions or events causing the transition
  - Type of transition (sequential, conditional, retry)

**Flow Properties:**
- Include additional metadata like state changes, conditions, timers, retries, etc.

**Simplify the Nodes:**
- Each node should have the name of the process or entity (not all details).
- Detailed descriptions can be shown on the edges or tooltips.

**Clarify the Edges:**
- Each edge should contain information about the transition, conditions, retry logic, or timer usage.

### Example Output Format: (output in Mermaid syntax)

Please convert my provided JSON code to a flow property graph in the following Mermaid format.
