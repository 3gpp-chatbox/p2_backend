    prompt = f"""
You are a 3GPP procedure analysis expert and logic validator.

You are given:
1. A **flow property graph** (state-event-transition model) extracted from the 3GPP procedure: "{section_name}".
2. The **original 3GPP specification section text** from which the graph was generated.

---

###  Your task:
Evaluate the accuracy and completeness of the flow graph by comparing it to the provided specification content. Identify any of the following issues:

####  What to Detect:
1. **Missing components**: States, events, or transitions that are clearly described in the spec but not included in the graph.
2. **Incorrect components**:
   - Wrong classifications (e.g., event misclassified as state).
   - Mismatches in semantics (e.g., wrong state label).
3. **Incorrect edge types**:
   - `trigger` used where `condition` is correct, or vice versa.
4. **Conflicting node types**:
   - Same node appears as both a state and an event.
5. **Invalid graph structure**:
   - `from` or `to` fields in edges that do not match any node `id`.
6. **Fatal errors**:
   - If the graph is fundamentally incorrect or contains no relevant structure from the spec.

---

### Reasoning Process (Required but do not return your analysis in response):

Before writing the corrections:
- Skim the **spec section line by line**.
- Identify each state, event, and transition described or implied.
- For each, **check whether it exists in the graph**, is correctly classified, and is connected correctly.
- Compare **temporal/cause-effect language** such as: "after", "once", "triggers", "causes", "leads to", etc.

You may use your domain knowledge to **interpret** terminology or message purpose, but you must **not invent or assume** content not clearly supported by the text.

---
