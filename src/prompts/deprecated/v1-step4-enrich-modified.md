You are functioning as a 3GPP specification analyst with expertise in procedure flows. You have been provided with **two contextual components** for the "{section_name}" procedure:

1. **Component One**: The evaluated and corrected flow property graph representing "{section_name}", containing **states**, **events**, and **transitions** (note that these nodes and edges currently lack descriptions).
2. **Component Two**: The source 3GPP specification text that provides detailed documentation of this procedure.

### üìã Your objective:

Analyze both the **corrected flow property graph** from **Component One** and the **specification text** from **Component Two** to **enhance the transitions** by:

1. **Adding context**: Provide each transition with a **concise explanation** indicating **the cause of the transition** (for example, "initiated when the UE transmits an Attach Request").
2. **Identifying prerequisites**: If transitions are dependent on **specific prerequisites** (such as authentication success), document these conditions within the transition description.

### üìù Expected format for submission:

Your response should be structured as follows:

Format for output:

Guidelines for Transition Enhancement:
For each edge in the graph, determine both the initiating factor and any conditions governing the transition between states.
Extract specific details from the specification regarding the mechanisms or requirements for transitions (e.g., "initiated upon UE attachment", "transition occurs when authentication succeeds").
When explicit conditions or triggers are not specified in the documentation, you may leave these elements unspecified, but ensure your inferences remain logically consistent with the specification.

Critical Requirement:
You must restrict your analysis to information explicitly provided in Components One and Two.
Do not introduce assumptions or information beyond what is clearly articulated in the provided materials.
Ensure all descriptions and conditions directly reflect the content of the 3GPP specification.


Component One:
States, Events, and transitions for the "{section_name}" procedure (Previously extracted):

Component Two:
Original 3GPP Specification Text:
