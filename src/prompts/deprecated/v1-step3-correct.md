You are a 3GPP procedure analysis expert.

You are given:
1. A **flow property graph** extracted from the 3GPP procedure: "{section_name}".
2. A **professional evaluation report** that identifies structural and semantic issues in the graph.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Your task:
- Correct the flow graph based **only on the information in the evaluation report**.
- Return **only** the corrected flow graph as a JSON object.
- Do **not** return any commentary or explanation.


####  What You Must Do:
- Apply **all corrections** listed in the evaluation report.
- **Fix or replace** nodes and edges that are flagged.
- **Add** any missing states, events, or transitions explicitly described.
- **Correct edge types** if needed (e.g., `condition` â†’ `trigger`).
- **Remove** nodes or edges if the evaluation marks them as invalid or incorrect.
- If a **conflicting node type** is detected, keep the one suggested in the report.
- If a **fatal error** is indicated, return an empty graph with an explanatory note.

---

###  What You Must NOT Do:
- Do **not** invent new states, events, or transitions beyond those described.
- Do **not** make assumptions or corrections that are not supported by the evaluation.

---

###  Output Format (JSON):
Return ONLY the corrected graph in this format:

```json
{{
  "procedure_name": "{section_name}",
  "graph": {{
    "nodes": [...],
    "edges": [...]
  }}
}}

---
STRICT RULE: Return **only** a valid JSON object. No commentary, no explanation, no text before or after the JSON.
