# MCP

## Context7

- Always use the context7 MCP server to reference documentation for libraries to get up to date documentation.
- Begin with 10000 tokens and increase to 25000 tokens if the initial documentation results are insufficient.

## Sequential Thinking

- Utilize the Sequential Thinking MCP server when dealing with complex problems that require dynamic reasoning and iterative refinement. Or when planning for big changes across multiple files.
